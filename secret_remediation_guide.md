# Git Repository Secret Remediation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides a comprehensive approach for DevOps engineers to identify, analyze, and remove sensitive data from Git repositories using TruffleHog and other Git tools.

## Current Scan Results

Based on the TruffleHog scan of this repository, the following secrets were identified:

### Secrets Found:
1. **AWS Access Keys** in multiple commits:
   - `AKIAQYLPMN5HHHFPZAM2` (new_key file)
   - `AKIAYVP4CIPPERUVIFXG` (keys file)

2. **AWS Secret Access Keys**:
   - `1tUm636uS1yOEcfP5pvfqJ/ml36mF7AkyHsEU0IUi` (new_key file)
   - `Zt2U1h267eViPnuSA+JO5ABhiu4T7XUMSZ+Y2Oth` (keys file)

3. **SSH Private Key** (OpenSSH format) in `keys` file

4. **Basic Auth Credentials**:
   - `https://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth`

### Affected Commits:
- `0416560` - "adding a key" (new_key file with AWS credentials)
- `77b2a3e` - "adding stuff" (SSH private key and basic auth)
- `742a554` - "woops, some keys" (AWS credentials in keys file)
- `fbc1430` - "doing some dev work" (initial AWS credentials)

## Remediation Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions
1. **Revoke all exposed credentials immediately**
2. **Notify security team**
3. **Change all passwords and regenerate keys**

### Phase 2: Repository Cleanup
1. **Remove secrets from current files**
2. **Clean commit history using git-filter-repo or BFG Repo-Cleaner**
3. **Force push cleaned history**
4. **Notify all team members to re-clone**

### Phase 3: Prevention
1. **Implement pre-commit hooks**
2. **Set up CI/CD secret scanning**
3. **Use secret management tools**
4. **Team training on secure coding practices**

## Tools Required
- TruffleHog (already installed)
- git-filter-repo (recommended) or BFG Repo-Cleaner
- Pre-commit hooks
- Secret management solution (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)

## Next Steps
Run the provided remediation scripts in the following order:
1. `backup_repository.sh` - Create backup
2. `cleanup_secrets.sh` - Remove secrets from history
3. `setup_prevention.sh` - Set up future protection
